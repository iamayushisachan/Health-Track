# Health‑Track Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for **Health‑Track**! This document provides an overview of the project architecture, explains key components, and outlines possible areas for extension.

## Project Overview

Health‑Track is a web-based reminder app for managing medication schedules. The core idea is to provide users with timed alerts and an easy way to look up information about each drug. The project is small and modular, making it simple to understand and extend.

## Folder Structure

```
Health-Track/
├── index.html       # Main page of the application
├── scripts.js       # JavaScript logic for handling reminders (if present)
├── styles.css       # Styling for the app (if present)
├── HealthTrack.zip  # Zipped version of the project (legacy)
├── Medication.zip   # Sample data or additional assets (legacy)
└── README.md        # Project README (this file)
```

*(Note: Actual file names may differ. Check your repository for exact names.)*

### index.html
This file contains the HTML structure of the application. It likely includes elements like:

- **Medication form:** A form where users can add medication names, dosages, and times.
- **Medication list:** A section that displays each medication added, along with buttons for editing or deleting entries.
- **Search links:** For each medication, a button or icon linking to Google search for additional information.

### scripts.js
If a `scripts.js` file exists, it probably handles:

- **Event listeners:** Capturing user input from the medication form.
- **Reminder scheduling:** Using JavaScript timers (`setTimeout`/`setInterval`) to trigger alerts at specified times.
- **Form validation:** Ensuring that the user enters valid medication names and times.
- **Dynamic DOM updates:** Adding and removing medications from the list on the page without reloads.

### styles.css
This file provides the styles for the app, such as fonts, colors, layouts, and spacing. Consider customizing it to match your preferred aesthetic.

## Extending the Project

Here are some ideas for how you can expand Health‑Track:

1. **Persistent Storage:** Use `localStorage` or `IndexedDB` to store user medications and reminders so they persist after refreshing the page or closing the browser.
2. **User Accounts:** Implement a backend to allow user authentication and store medication data on the server.
3. **Push Notifications:** Integrate the Web Notifications API or service workers to send notifications even when the browser is closed.
4. **Mobile App:** Develop a mobile version using frameworks like React Native or Flutter.
5. **Data Visualization:** Show charts or timelines of medication adherence to help users identify patterns.
6. **Accessibility Enhancements:** Provide keyboard navigation and screen-reader support to make the app accessible to all users.
